    abriTAMR is an AMR gene detection pipeline that runs AMRFinderPlus on a single (or list ) of given isolates and collates the results into a table, separating genes identified into functionally relevant groups. abriTAMR is accredited by NATA for use in reporting the presence of reportable AMR genes in Victoria Australia. Acquired resistance mechanims in the form of point mutations (restricted to subset of species) Streamlined output. Presence of virulence factors
