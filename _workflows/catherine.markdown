description: >
    With this galaxy pipeline you can use <em>Salmonella sp.</em> next generation sequencing results to predict bacterial AMR phenotypes and compare the results against gold standard <em>Salmonella sp.</em> phenotypes obtained from food.</br></br>This pipeline is based on the work of the <em>National Food Agency of Canada</em>.
